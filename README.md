## Inroduction

SoundScape is a fun Python project that visualizes the real-time audio recorded through a microphone, using the [PyAudio](https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/) and [PySimpleGUI](https://pypi.org/project/PySimpleGUI/) libraries. It creates a dynamic and interactive soundscape that changes according to the sound input. You can use it to explore the sound properties of different environments, such as a busy street, a quiet park, or a noisy classroom.

SoundScape provides different visualizers(or processors) that allows users to observe and test different aspects and features of sound.
