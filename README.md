#SoundScape
SoundScape is a Python project that visualizes real-time audio recorded through a microphone, utilizing the PyAudio and PySimpleGUI libraries. It creates a dynamic and interactive soundscape that adapts according to the sound input. This tool enables users to explore the sound properties of different environments, such as a bustling street, a serene park, or a lively classroom.

#Visualizers
SoundScape offers various visualizers to analyze the audio input:

##1. Waveform
The Waveform visualizer provides a graphical representation of the audio signal's amplitude over time. It displays the intensity of the sound wave, allowing users to observe the variations in loudness.

<br>


##2. Spectrogram
The Spectrogram visualizer illustrates the frequency content of the audio signal over time. It represents how the intensity of different frequencies changes over time, providing insights into the spectral characteristics of the sound.

##3. Frequency vs. Amplitude
The Frequency vs. Amplitude visualizer simultaneously displays changes in both frequency and amplitude in real-time sound. It offers a comprehensive view of how the pitch and volume of the sound vary over time, enabling users to understand the dynamic nature of the audio input.
