# SoundScape
SoundScape is a Python project that visualizes the real-time audio recorded through a microphone, using the PyAudio and PySimpleGUI libraries. It creates a dynamic and interactive soundscape that changes according to the sound input. You can use it to explore the sound properties of different environments, such as a busy street, a quiet park, or a noisy classroom.

*SoundScape has different visualizers. Let's learn about them:*

## 1. Waveform

This visualizes the waveform of audio in real time.

## 2. Spectogram

This visualizes the change in frequency across time.

## 3. Frequency v/s Amplitude

This visualizes the changes in frequency and amplitude in real time sound.
